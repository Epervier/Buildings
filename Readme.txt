Buildings
==================
This project is an expiriment in procedural generation.  My goal is to make a simple city that contains a few districts, and each of those district has a bunch of simple buildings in them.  Ideally you will be able to pass in data about a couple different types of buildings, which will change how many of each type is spawned and where.
